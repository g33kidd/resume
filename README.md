# A g33k's Resume

Looks like you've found my resume! Awesome! This is a document of my Skills, Projects and Experiences if you're wondering what they are.

### Projects
You can find a lot of my projects here on GitHub, but I also have a lot of private repositories over on GitLab. Would be happy to let you have a look, if you're interested.

### Skills
I've worked with a number of frameworks and languages. Here's just a few, listed by their level of importance to me.

**Backend Frameworks**: Ruby on Rails, Phoenix, AdonisJS, Express, Laravel, Kemalyst

**Front-end Frameworks**: React, VueJS, EmberJS, Angular, Backbone

**Languages**: Ruby, Elixir, Crystal, NodeJS/JavaScript, C#(Unity), Python, Kotlin, Java, R, PHP

### Experience

###### Pro Rivalry League, Remote – 2016 to Present – Developer Operations
**Tech**: WordPress, NodeJS, AdonisJS, Laravel, VueJS, ReactJS, Elixir, Python

PRL is one of the finest eSport tournament organizations for Rocket League. We host weekly events that allow players to compete for a prize-pool. We build the primary features on http://prorl.com that allow players to find their matches and signup for tournaments. We're also building Overlay tools to allow our Broadcasters and casters show detailed information about the current matches that are being played at any given moment.

I'm primarily responsible for helping manage our developers and getting the development done. This is a volunteer job.

###### WebDevStudios, Remote – 2016 – Back-end Consultant
**Tech**: WordPress, jQuery, Sass, Gulp, Grunt, NodeJS

Being a back-end developer at WDS was exciting. Not only because of the projects, but because of the people working there. Truly awesome people. I mainly worked with WordPress, Backbone.js, jQuery, and SCSS.

###### Folsom Creative, Fort Collins, CO – 2014 to 2016 – Lead Developer
**Tech**: WordPress, jQuery, Sass, Gulp, Grunt, NodeJS, Meteor, Ruby on Rails, Elixir

Working at Folsom was face-paced, relaxed, and a lot of work. It was also just 3 people at the time, so we put in work. We worked with WordPress primarily, along with the SASSY-Sass, JavaScript (jQuery, Backbone), and used Gulp/Grunt as build tools. I did have a project I built using MeteorJS, it was for a 20+ website dashboard that pulled in Google Analytics data every day. Overall I learned quite a bit about business working there.

###### Deviceful Inc. – Remote/Irvine, CA – 2013 to 2014 – Software Engineer
**Tech**: WordPress, Ruby on Rails, Swift, Java

Deviceful was mostly an experimental company. We built mobile apps, web services, and a number of other things. Unfortunately the things we built were never released and had to abandon ship. I do still have some of the code I had built there, in GitHub some places. An example is my FallinDots game, which was built for iOS using Swift (https://github.com/g33kidd/FallinDots). This was released, but my iOS Developer License expired and had no interested in re-paying it.

###### GetQD – 2014 – Django Developer/Reporting System
**Tech**: WordPress, Django, Python, Celery

### Why should you hire me?
Over the years I've done a number of things. From building a web app with an OAuth Provider and API that communicates with React, to building a Flight Sim stats analyzer using FSUIPC, SimConnect, and C#. Obviously, I don't know everything there is to know, though I've definitely retained a lot of information over the years. It's probably coming up on 7 or 8 years since I've been programming.

I **Love** building things. Especially awesome software that people use. That's why I started programming, so I could build stuff and solve complicated (or not so much) problems.

I do indeed work well in a team. With PRL I work with over 40+ people doing things such as Graphics, Management, Development and other PR stuff. I've worked remote a couple of times and absolutely love it, though I also like working in an office setting.

Well, I guess, if you like what you seen. Or if you're curious to know more. Please email me at kidd.josh.343@gmail.com and I'll get back to you!

**P.S.**: If I sent this to you as a Resume, please let me know what you think or why you weren't interested in me. Thanks!
