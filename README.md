### Projects
You can find a lot of my projects here on GitHub [@g33kidd](https://github.com/g33kidd), but I also have a lot of private repositories over on GitLab. If you let me know, I would gladly give you access to private repos if you would like to take a look. Some of my projects on GitHub are unfinished or no longer updated.

#### G33KBot (2017)

**Repo**: https://github.com/g33kidd/g33kbot

**Status**: Updating occasionally.

I'm huge into Discord. As I use it daily I thought it would be fun to build a bot in my favorite language, Crystal. During development of this project, I streamed live on twitch. For the first thing I created a command runner, which takes in some content and determines which command is able to run for the message created. Lastly, I created a controller that adds Recast.ai functionality so users in my server can chat with the bot, ask questions and much more! Overall, this was a quick project, but a fun one!

#### SocialFund (2017)
**Repo**: Private

~~**Website**: https://fund.social~~

**Status**: Offline.

SocialFund ~~is~~ was a Social Crowdfunding platform. Think twitter for crowdfunding. You send "notes" to crowdfunding campaigns in a timeline of notes. Each note comes with a donation for the cause. First version was built for my mother as a basic version.

#### Notable Mentions

- [Dropbox API NodeJS](https://github.com/g33kidd/node-dropbox) –– Not currently maintained.
- [Jet](https://github.com/g33kidd/jet) –– DOM tree implementation in Crystal

### Experience

#### Rival Esports –– _**2016 to Present**_
**Location** Remote

**Stack** WordPress, Node.js, Elixir, Laravel, React.js

**Website** http://rivalesports.com/ | http://twitch.tv/prorivalry

PRL is one of the finest eSport tournament organizations for Rocket League. We host weekly events that allow players to compete for a prize-pool. We build the primary features on http://prorl.com that allow players to find their matches and signup for tournaments. We're also building Overlay tools to allow our Broadcasters and casters show detailed information about the current matches that are being played at any given moment. This is a volunteer position.

#### WebDevStudios –– _**2016**_ –– Backend Consultant
**Stack**: WordPress, jQuery, Sass, Gulp, Grunt, NodeJS

**Website**: http://webdevstudios.com

Being a back-end developer at WDS was exciting. Not only because of the projects, but because of the people working there. Truly awesome people. I mainly worked with WordPress themes and plugins.

#### Folsom Creative –– _**2014 to 2016**_ – Lead Developer
**Stack**: WordPress, jQuery, Sass, Gulp, Grunt, NodeJS, Meteor, Ruby on Rails, Elixir

**Website**: http://folsomcreative.com

Working at Folsom was face-paced, relaxed, and a lot of work. It was also just 3 people at the time, so we put in work. We worked with WordPress primarily, along with the SASSY-Sass, JavaScript (jQuery, Backbone), and used Gulp/Grunt as build tools. I did have a project I built using MeteorJS, it was for a 20+ website dashboard that pulled in Google Analytics data every day. Overall I learned quite a bit about business working there.

#### Deviceful Inc. –– _**2013 to 2014**_ –– Software Engineer
**Location** Irvine, CA

**Stack**: WordPress, Ruby on Rails, Swift, Java

Deviceful was mostly an experimental company. We built mobile apps, web services, and a number of other things. Unfortunately the things we built were never released and had to abandon ship. I do still have some of the code I had built there, in GitHub some places. An example is my FallinDots game, which was built for iOS using Swift (https://github.com/g33kidd/FallinDots).

#### GetQD/Showpass –– _**2014**_ –– Django Developer/Reporting System
**Location** Remote

**Stack** WordPress, Django, Python, Celery

**Website** http://myshowpass.com

GetQD or now known as ShowPass is a ticketing system similar to EventBrite. It also has some venue management systems built in. I worked on building some reporting system back-end stuff. Also built a theme for WordPress.

#### RiteTag –– _**2013**_ – PHP Developer Intern
**Location** Remote

**Stack**: PHP, MySQL, Yii Framework

**Website**: http://RiteKit.com

Working with RiteTag was primarily me working on various bug fixes. I started a massive refactoring project to help make the code more readable, that eventually helped in letting others join the RiteTag team.

### Why should you hire me?
Over the years I've done a number of things. From building a web app with an OAuth Provider and API that communicates with React, to building a Flight Sim stats analyzer using FSUIPC, SimConnect, and C#. Obviously, I don't know everything there is to know, though I've definitely retained a lot of information over the years. It's probably coming up on 7 or 8 years since I've been programming and I'd like to contiune programming.

I **LOVE** building things. Especially awesome software that people use. That's why I started programming, so I could build stuff and solve problems.

I do indeed work well in a team. With PRL I work with over 40+ people doing things such as Graphics, Management, Development and PR stuff. I've worked remote a couple of times and absolutely love it, though I also like working in an office setting.

If you like what you see or if you're curious to know more. Please email me at kidd.josh.343@gmail.com and I'll get back to you! Or if you use discord you can find me at "g33kidd#2163" and send me a DM :)
